# Syllabus: CSCI 3907/6907: Usable Security and Privacy

## Course Description

Humans are often considered the weakest link in security. A provable secure system is only useful if it can be actually used by users, and system designers need to account for human behavior if they wish to have both security and usability. In this class, we will examine factors of usability of security and privacy though a research-based, project-driven examination. We will cover core areas of security and privacy, as well as cover methods in human interaction (HCI) that can be used to measure the usability of security and privacy. Student are expected to complete problem sets on the topic and complete a research-based project. 

## Learning Objectives

1. Read and write critical critiques of scientific papers in the are of security, privacy, and usability.
2. Understand and apply research methods in human factors in computing
3. Develop relevant hypothesis and research questions in the space of usable security and privacy
4. Design and deploy a research study and analyze the results
5. Describe, support, and effectively argue a result using the best practices of scientific writing
6. Understand ethical issues related to human factors research in security and privacy
7. Understanding of the major topics and themes of usable security and privacy

## CSCI 3907 vs CSCI 6907

CSCI 3907 (undergraduate) is a subset of CSCI 6907 (graduate). Throughout this syllabus, additional requirement of CSCI 6907 students will be noted. Undergraduate students who are dual enrolled must complete the CSCI 6907 requirements.

Undergraduates who wish to complete CSCI 6907 requirements and are not dual enrolled will be eligible for a letter grade bonus, e.g., from B+ to A-. However, you must complete *all* the assignments. Partial bonus will no be awarded. 

## Textbook

There is no required textbook for this class. However, there are suggested textbooks you can reference if needed.

* **Research Methods in Human-Computer Interaction** by Jonathan Lazar, Jinjuan Heidi Feng, Harry Hochheiser. 
* **README FIRST for a User's Guide to Qualitative Methods** by Lyn Richards and Janice M. Morse

* Quizzes: 2%
* Presentations: 8%
* Exams: 15%

### Project

This class requires that you complete a semester long research project that should produce workshop-level research results and a written report that is formatted using Latex. You must works in teams of at least two to complete the project. You cannot work alone. 

More details of the project can be found on the [project](project.md) page. 

### Problem Sets

We have five problem sets in this class that will require a mixture of programming, writing, and data analysis. Specific directions in the problem sets will be provided. All written work should be submitted typed, and all programming assignments should be submitted via git. 

### Readings

Each week readings are listed as either *Required* or *Additional*. 

* *All* students are required to complete the *Required Readings* 
* CSCI 3907 must complete at least **one** Reading Response Form for each class from the Required Readings
* CSCI 6907 must complete at least **two** Reading Response Forms, one from the Required Readings and one more from either the Required Readings or Additional Readings.

To verify that you are keeping up with the readings, you need to submit[reading response form](reading.md), which should be typed and submitted in hard copy at the start of class. 

If you wish to read a *different* research paper for your additional reading, you may do so with the instructor permission. 

### Quizzes

At the start of most classes, to check if the required reading were complete, we will have a very short quiz. These quiz will be self graded and used to spur conversation. 

### Presentations

Each week, we will have student presentations of the *additional* readings, or an approved reading of the student's choice. These presentations should be roughly 20 minutes in length and follow the styles of academic presentations at conferences and workshops. For each session, we will typically have 2 or 3 presentations. 

* CSCI 3907 students must complete at least **one** presentation throughout the semester
* CSCI 6907 students must complete at least **two** presentations throughout the semester

When a student is presenting, they are not required to do any reading response form(s). 

### Exams

We will have a two exams in the class, roughly halfway through and at the end of the term. These exams will cover topics from the readings and topics presented in class.

## Academic Integrity

The George Washington University has a [Code of Academic Integrity](https://studentconduct.gwu.edu/academic-integrity) which we will follow in this class.  Violations of the code, depending on severity, may lead to any (or all) of the following actions within this class:

* Receiving a 0% on the assignment in which a violation is found
* Dismissal from the course
* Receiving a failing grade in the class

Further action may occur, including referring the case to the Academic Integrity Council for further adjudication.

## Collaboration Policy 

If you have any question about whether some activity would constitute cheating, please feel free to ask. Simply stated, feel free to discuss problems with each other, but do not cheat. It is not worth it, and you will get caught.

### Problem Sets

You may discuss the problem sets with your instructor and fellow students; however, unauthorized assistance must be limited to discussion of the problem, general sketches of approaches. You may *never* share code or solutions, or consulting another students solution is not permitted and constitutes cheating. 

If a problem within a problem set allows group work, you may work together towards a solution; however, each student *must* submit their own copy of the problem set with descriptions in their own words. 

### Readings

You may discuss any readings with any classmate, but your reading response form should be your own work in your own words. Copying a reading response form constitutes cheating. 

### Quizzes and Exams
No collaboration is permitted on quizzes or exams. 

### Projects
You are expect to cite and reference all sources used in your project write-up. You should clearly cite any idea that is not your own.

## Ethical and Respectful Behavior

We expect all students to act in an respectful and ethical way, both with respect to the treatment of their peers in the classroom during discussion but also in the design and execution of their course projects. Actions should meet the expectations of ethical research and follow the norms and proper behavior of the George Washington University community.


## Wellness

If any issue arises that may limit your ability to participate in class, for example, personal illness, family emergency, etc., please be sure to discuss these matters with your instructor as soon as possible and accommodations will be made available to you as appropriate.

Feelings of being overwhelmed are unfortunately quite common in the University environment and something we have all dealt with. You are not alone, and there are a number of resources available to provide support in those moments. Learning to ask for help is an import part of the university of experience, and if you or anyone you know experiences any academic stress, difficult life events, or feelings of anxiety or depression, we strongly encourage you to seek support. GW offers [counciling services](https://healthcenter.gwu.edu/counseling-and-psychological-services), and also consider also reaching out to a friend, faculty or family member you trust for help getting connected to the support that can help.
