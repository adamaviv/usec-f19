# Problem Set 1

** Due via Github classroom **

## Problem 1 (35 points)

Github Classroom Link: https://classroom.github.com/a/BOqfBE0n

In light of the "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" paper, you will perform an expert evaluation of a current encryption tool. Pick a tool from [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) of encryption tools. In particular, consider tools listed at the bottom of that page under the "disk encryption," "email clients," and "OTR" messaging categories. Download and install (or, if applicable, simply enable) the tool you chose. Inspired by the Johnny paper, perform an expert evaluation of the tool.

You should turn in four paragraphs describing:

* Paragraph 1: State what tool you chose and describe the steps you took in your expert evaluation. Essentially, we want you to explain your methodology.
* Paragraph 2: What usability flaws identified in the Johnny paper still persist 15 years later in this tool? Describe them.
* Paragraph 3: What usability flaws does this tool have beyond those previously identified in the Johnny paper? Describe them.
* Paragraph 4: What usability flaws identified in the Johnny paper have been addressed to your satisfaction? How were they addressed?

If you believe any of those paragraphs is not applicable (e.g., the tool has no usability flaws not described in the Johnny paper), instead briefly explain why you believe it is not applicable.

In the github classroom assignment, create a document called `evaluation.md` and write your report using markdown formatting. 

## Problem 2 (15 points)

In class, we watched excerpts of the [12-minute video](https://vimeo.com/56881481) Edward Snowden made for Glenn Greenwald. We laughed; we cried. Can you do better? 

In three paragraphs or less, try to explain everything a journalist needs to know about using whatever encryption tool you examined in Problem 1. Do your best! 

In addition to the paragraph you write, write one or two sentences reflecting on this experience. (For example, Have you communicated everything the journalist needs to know? If not, what's missing?)

In the github classroom assignement, create a document called `advice.md` and `refelections.md` to write your report using markdown formatting. 

## Problem 3 (35 points)

Github Classroom Link: https://classroom.github.com/g/W7isq8Ki

In teams of two or by yourself, complete one of these two tasks:

1. observe people in a public place using a computerized system. For example, you might observe people using a public transit ticket machine at the Foggy Bottom Metro Station, a parking garage pay station (under the SEAS building), an automatic store self-checkout machine (at the CVS in District House), a library self-checkout machine (at the DC public library), or an airport self-check-in kiosk (at DCA ... a short 15 minute metro ride away!). Stay long enough to observe both experienced and inexperienced users using the system.

2. Recruit a few people (~5) you know and observe them using a computer or computerized device or system for a selected task. For example, this can be logging onto a system using their smartphone, performing two factor authentication, searching for help online for a task, using GW's IT help page, etc. Try to recruit some who have used the device or complete the task before and some who have not. Once complete, ask your participants to answer questions from the [System Usability Scale](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html) with respect to their task and system. 

For both procedures, what kinds of problems did people have using the system or completing the task? What aspects mad it easy to learn? What aspects appeared to be too difficult? What aspects seemed to frustrate experienced users? Most importantly, how might the design of the system be improved? 

Write up a short report on your observations and recommendations to submit via github classroom. This can either be as a latex document or as a markdown document. It should either be named `report.md` or `report.pdf`. Include materials  with photographs or sketches of key elements of the user interface and tasks you observed. You should include some basic stasitics, such as timings and the results of the SUS, if you conducted it. 

When printed, the report should be about 2-4 pages, plus the appendix. You should include the following sections

* Introduction: Describe the two tasks performed, basic observations, and general findings
* Methods: Describe the specific methodologies you used
* Results: Describe any results and statistics
* Conclusion: What are your general findings?

Only need to submit one report per group, but be sure to include everyone's name. 
 
## Problem 4 (10 points, and you MUST complete this to pass this class)

Github Classroom Link: https://classroom.github.com/a/W-U0a536

Complete the online Human Subjects Protection Training Requirement by following the instructions at the [GW Office of Human Research](https://humanresearch.gwu.edu/citi-courses-accounts-info). You should complete the **Social & Behavioral Research** course. Whence complete, include a copy of your certificate in your submission call `certificate.pdf`

**Note that you do not have to pay for this course if you follow the instructions at the link above. GW pays for a school wide license.**

## Problem 5 (5 points, and you are strongly recommended to complete this)

Github Classroom Link: https://classroom.github.com/a/Joll3gcD

Request access to the Qualtrics Site License for SEAS. Information can be found on the [GW SEAS Computing Facility help page](https://seascf.seas.gwu.edu/qualtrics).

Then create a simple survey with the following questions, and then publish the survey and take it yourself. The questions are:

* What topics in this course most excite you?

* What topic in this course least excites you?

* Describe your earliest experience with using a computer? 

To prove you've done the task, include a link to the published survey in your submission in a file called `survey.md` as well as a pdf of the results as presented by Qualtrics called `results.pdf`.
