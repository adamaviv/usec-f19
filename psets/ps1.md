# Problem Set 1

** Due via Github classroom **
* Problem 1 (github classroom link)
* Problem 2 (github classroom link)
* Problem 3 (github classroom link)


## Problem 1 (35 points)

In light of the "Why Johnny Can't Encrypt" paper, you will perform an expert evaluation of a current encryption tool. Pick a tool from [Wikipedia's list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption_software) of encryption tools. In particular, consider tools listed at the bottom of that page under the "disk encryption," "email clients," and "OTR" messaging categories. Download and install (or, if applicable, simply enable) the tool you chose. Inspired by the Johnny paper, perform an expert evaluation of the tool.

You should turn in four paragraphs describing:

* Paragraph 1: State what tool you chose and describe the steps you took in your expert evaluation. Essentially, we want you to explain your methodology.
* Paragraph 2: What usability flaws identified in the Johnny paper still persist 15 years later in this tool? Describe them.
* Paragraph 3: What usability flaws does this tool have beyond those previously identified in the Johnny paper? Describe them.
* Paragraph 4: What usability flaws identified in the Johnny paper have been addressed to your satisfaction? How were they addressed?

If you believe any of those paragraphs is not applicable (e.g., the tool has no usability flaws not described in the Johnny paper), instead briefly explain why you believe it is not applicable.


## Problem 2 (15 points) 

In class, we watched excerpts of the [12-minute video](https://vimeo.com/56881481) Edward Snowden made for Glenn Greenwald. We laughed; we cried. Can you do better? 

In three paragraphs or less, try to explain everything a journalist needs to know about using whatever encryption tool you examined in Problem 1. Do your best! 

In addition to the paragraph you write, write one or two sentences reflecting on this experience. (For example, Have you communicated everything the journalist needs to know? If not, what's missing?)

## Problem 3 (35 points)

In teams of two (or by yourself with instructor permission), you have two main tasks:

1. observe people in a public place using a computerized system. For example, you might observe people using a public transit ticket machine at the Foggy Bottom stop, a parking garage pay station (under the SEAS building), a automatic store self-checkout machine (at the CVS), a library self-checkout machine (at the DC public library), or an airport self-check-in kiosk (at DCA ... a short 15 minute metro ride away!). Stay long enough to observe both experienced and inexperienced users using the system.

2. Recruit a few people (~5) you know and observe them using a computer or computerized device or system for a selected task. For example, this can be logging onto a system using their smartphone, performing two factor authentication, searching for help online for a task, using GW's IT help page, etc. Try to recruit some who have used the device or complete the task before and some who have not. Once complete, ask your participants to answer questions from the [System Usability Scale](https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/system-usability-scale.html) with respect to their task and system. 

During both procedures, what kinds of problems did people have using the system or completing the task? What aspects mad it easy to learn? What aspects appeared to be too difficult? What aspects seemed to frustrate experienced users? Most importantly, how might the design of the system be improved? 

Write up a short report on your observations and recommendations to submit via github classroom. This can either be as a latex document or as a markdown document. Include materials  with photographs or sketches of key elements of the user interface and tasks you observed. You should include some basic stasitics, such as timings and the results of the SUS. 

When printed, the report should be about 2-4 pages, plus the appendix. You should include the following sections

* Introduction: Describe the two tasks performed, basic observations, and general findings
* Methods: Describe the specific methodologies you used
* Results: Describe any results and statistics
* Conclusion: What are your general findings?

Only need to submit one report per group, but be sure to include everyone's name.
