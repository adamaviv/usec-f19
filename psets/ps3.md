# Problem Set 3

# Problem 1 (15 points)

* Github classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/HnrKngqC

We've discussed a lot about how to conduct ecologically valid user studies, but you should also experience it from the other side -- and you can make some pocket change along the way. *Sign up for [prolific](https://app.prolific.co) using your **personal** email address (not your GW) email address*. 

Once you do so, you should finish the following tasks:

1. Complete the introduction study (this is required by prolific)

2. Go to the "About You" page fill in the **Basic demographic variables**, the **geographic variables**, and **education**. 

3. Complete at least **two** studies advertised under **studies**.

For submission, you must include two screenshots:

1. A screenshot of the  **About You** page showing you completed the screening questions. 

2. A screenshot of the **Submissions** page show you completed two studies

Finally, you should **submit** a paragraph in a file `reflections.md` that describe some reflections from participating in these studies and how it may affect how you conduct studies.

Run a study on prolific. 

## Running a study on Prolific
To do this, you will need to sign up for a *second* prolific account. This time use your GW email address, and register as a requester. Be sure to read the instructions carefully as there is easy integration with Qualtrics. 

> Note this survey should cost you about $35 (less than the cost of a textbook), but if this is a financial burden for you. Please let me know ASAP. In fact, no one should spend more than $35 to complete this problem. 

Based on the research prompt below, you should target less than 10 minute survey paying $2.50, for a $15 per hour rate. With overheads for prolific, your total cost should be almost exactly $35. **Be sure to pre-test your survey to verify that it takes <10 minutes. 

Finally, as this study is being conducted for educational purposes and not for generalize knowledge, you do not have to get IRB approval. However, the expectation is that you conduct your study with the same level of care as if you had approval. This includes:

1. Treating all participants ethically and fairly
2. Providing confidentiality linking personal information of participants to data.
3. Informing participants that they are participating in a research project for a class.
4. If deception was used, providing post-procedure information to participants


Additionally, prolific has additional rules for their service which requires researchers to not collect any identifiable information, such as full names and email addresses. Further, you may avoid collecting demographic information if participants pre-fill out the *About You* section.


## The theme of the study to run

Revelations from the past few years concerning widespread government surveillance have raised a number of questions about privacy and security. For example, have people started using Tor since hearing about government surveillance? What type of privacy tool do people most wish they had? Do attitudes about government surveillance differ between people from the US and people from India? Can average people determine what is or is not included in "metadata" about their telephone calls?

Pick any question of interest to you related to government surveillance and privacy. Although I strongly encourage you to come up with your own question, but you may choose one of the questions above. Then, design and conduct a 10-participant survey on Prolific to answer that question using Qualtrics to host your survey. 


## What to turn in

You should turn in the following things:

1.  `research.md` : file containing a clear description of your hypothesis, research methods, and recruitment material. You should also include at least two paragraphs describing the decisions you made in having your research methods match your research questions/hypotheses. 

2. `survey.pdf` : A pdf file of baldrics study you ran.

3. `report.pdf` : a written report with the results. Your report should include an abstract, introduction, methods, results, and conclusion section. It should be about 5 pages long (single column). For your results, you **should not** include the raw results. Instead you should have tables, graphs, and figures. If you used open ended questions, you should provide some thematic coding. 

# Problem 3 (10 points)

* github classroom link: https://classroom.github.com/a/08g0JI0z

Based on your research project for the class, generate an *annotated bibliography* of at least 15 research papers that are related to your paper. No more than 7 of the papers can be articles you've been assigned (either required or additional readings) for the class.

Try and identify articles in reputable venues, such as the same list of conferences and journals from which we've been reading articles in class. My best advice for finding further articles is to use Google scholar, both to look for keywords, but also which articles cite other articles. 

Each entry in your annotated bibliography should contain the following information.

1. Full citation of the article, including authors, title, conference/journal, page numbers or volumes (if relevant), and year published.

2. Two sentence description of the article's main findings.

3. One sentence describing how this article relates to your research.


You should submit a file called `bibliography.md` with this information.
