# Project

## Description

You are required to complete a semester long project working in groups of two or three on topics related to usability security and privacy. While it is not necessarily required, it is expected that all projects have a user study that can either be qualitative or quantitative. 

## Preferences

While the decision of groups and projects is at the discretion of the
instructor, you must submit a preference sheet that includes your preferred
group members and your preferred topic. For topics, you should provide a rank
order of three topics. Listing of group members will not be considered rank orders. 

If you would like to work on a topic not listed below, you may propose a new topic to the instructor.

## Proposals

Although a topic is assigned to you, you must still complete a proposal. Your proposal should include the following information:

1. What research questions/hypothesis do you plan to address?
2. What methods will you use in your investigate?
3. What is your recruitment plan and target demographic?
4. What is a timeline for your work?
5. What are the ethical considerations?
6. What is your analysis plan for any data you collect?

Following submission of your proposal, your group will schedule meetings with the instructor to get feedback and provide updates.

## Ethics Review

As part of your project, you will be required to complete an IRB application. As this project is for the purposes of education, not generalizable knowledge, we do not need IRB approval. However, we expect you to uphold the same standards as an IRB approved research. This includes:

1. Treating all participants ethically and fairly
2. Providing confidentiality linking personal information of participants to data.
3. Informing participants that they are participating in a research project for a class.
4. If deception was used, providing post-procedure information to participants.


## Status Updates

You are required to provide one status update for your project. This should include all the same material as the proposal, but with substantive updates on work completed and any changes that occurred since submission.

## Presentations

You will make two presentations about your project in class. The first is a "Lightening Talk" which will be a short 5 minute talk introducing the topic and your methods. This will enable all class members to learn about the work of everyone else.

The second presentation will be your final project presentation, which will be 15 minutes in length with 5 minutes of questions. These presentations should be inline with conference/workshop style presentations and provide some depth of the methods, analysis, and conclusions.

## Project Topics

Below is a non-exhaustive list of topics that you can use to build a proposal. You may also propose your own topics. 

* Biometrics 
  * As more and more devices use biometrics, how does this new convenient method of authentication impact older, knowledge based methods of authentication? Do people choose weaker PINs/Passwords if they have a biometric? What are people's opinions comparing biometrics with knowledge based authentication?
  * 

* Digital Secret Sharing 
  * If you were asked to send an password protected file, how would you do it? 
  
* Voice Assistants
  * Creepy or neccesary? How do people understand and use voice assistant technology?
  
* Two Factor Authentication
  * It's clearly better, but what might stop users from using it? 

* Developer studies
  * Bad code comes from somewhere ... what if you asked a class to complete a project
  
* Privacy Policies and Social Media

* Password Managers

* Mobile Browsers

* In-App Authentication

* Git security understandings
